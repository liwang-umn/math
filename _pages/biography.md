I am an Associate Professor in the School of Mathematics at the  University of Minnesota, since Aug. 2022, and an Assistant Professor from 2018â€”2022. 

Before came to Minnesota, I was an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math.html) 
and  [CDSE program](https://www.buffalo.edu/icds/programs-and-degrees/cdse.html), State University of New York at Buffalo. 
Prior to that, I was a CAM Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA, with Prof. [Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/). 
I got my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the supervision of Prof. [Shi Jin](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/shijin/#publications).

I am very fortunate to be the recipient of several awards, incluidng the Simons Fellows in Mathematics (2024), Simons Fellowship to visit Issac Newton Institute (2022), NSF CAREER grant (2019), AMS-Simons Travel grant (2014), PRIMA Travel grant (2013) and Elizabeth Hirschfelder Scholarship at UW-Madison (2012). I am also grateful to the support from NSF through DMS-1620135, DMS-1903420. 

Currently I serve on the editorial board of [Kinetic and Related Models](https://www.aimsciences.org/krm) and [Communications in Mathematical Sciences](https://intlpress.com/journals/journalList?id=1804413732712935425)
