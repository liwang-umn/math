I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Mathematics, University of Minnesota. My general research interests lie in applied mathematics, numerical analysis and scientific computing.



Before came to Minnesota, I spent half of five years as an assistant professor at the Department of Mathematics and  CDSE program, State University of New York at Buffalo, and another half as a CAM assistant adjunct professor at UCLA, with Prof. Andrea Bertozzi. I got my Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2012, under the supervision of Prof. Shi Jin.
